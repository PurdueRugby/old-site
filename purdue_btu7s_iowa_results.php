							<p> The Purdue Boilermakers Men's Rugby team finished with another successful weekend and earned them a 2nd place finish in the Big Ten Universities point standings, despite a slow start to the day. </p>
							</br>
							<p> The Boilermakers first match of the day versus Iowa saw Purdue take a 12-10 lead going into the break.  However the Hawkeyes would come back to score 19 unanswered points in the second half and walk away victorious </p>
							</br>
							<p> Not to be discouraged, Purdue's second opponent of the day saw the Boilermakers return to form and what would be the start of a 3-0 sweep of the remaining teams in the pool.  Two tries in each half of their match versus Creighton earned Purdue a 26-7 victory over the Blue Jays. </p>
							</br>
							<p> The third game of the day versus Minnesota saw a scoring explosion, with six different Boilermakers scoring and Eremia Tapsell going 5/7 in conversions.  Purdue's defense also played strong, and a 45-0 shutout against the Gophers saw Purdue move to 2-1 on the day. </p>
							</br>
							<p> The final match of pool play pitted Purdue against the Michigan Wolverines, who sat 2-0 in the pool up to that point.  The Wolverines, having defeated Purdue 19-5 at the ACRL 7s earlier in the season, came out fast.  But Purdue, having improved throughout the course of the day, held a 12-7 lead at the half.  Michigan would go on to equalize the score in the 2nd, but late game defensive heroics kept the score tied.  With the game tied and only one posession remaining, Jordan Davis powered through for the go-ahead try and would seal the victory for the Boilermakers. </p>
							</br>
							<p> With a 3-1 finish in pool play, Purdue earned a three-way-tie with Iowa (3-1) and Michigan (3-1).  Determined by tiebreakers, Iowa earned the #1 spot in the pool and would go on to face Notre Dame.  Purdue, earning the #2 spot in the pool, would see a rematch with Illinois to determine 3rd place. </p>
							</br>
							<p> In a well contested match, Purdue found itself down at halftime 14-12.  An early score in the 2nd half by Tapsell put Purdue ahead, but mistakes combined with two intercepted passes led to a 19-26 defeat to Illinois. Purdue would finish with a 3-2 record. </p>
							</br>
							<p> In total, ten of Purdue's twelve rostered players scored tries through the duration of the tournament. </p>
							</br>
							<p> As a result in having competed in both BTU7s Qualifier Tournaments, Purdue earned four bonus points in the standing and finished with the second highest point total in the Big Ten.  Purdue will carry a lot of momentum into next weeks Big Ten Universities 7s Finals in Illinois. </p>
							</br>
							<p> As always, Boiler Up! </p>
