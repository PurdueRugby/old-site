							<p> A pool of Iowa, Northwestern, and Indiana proved for a tough day in Champaign in late April. The Boilers started off the day against Iowa, a big and strong side that beat them a week prior on their home field. ET was the only Boiler to touch down in the first half, and his self-converted try took Purdue into the half down 10-7. Fortunately, the Boilers were able to pitch a second half shutout, and thanks to another try from ET and one from Dion Crowder, walked away with a 21-10 victory. A great way to start the day!</p>
							</br>
							<p> Second-up Northwestern proved to be a tougher challenge than originally thought, with the Wildcats going into the break up 12-7. Two tries from Ryan Vizek in the second half, along with a great push from the replacements off the bench, saw Purdue take another victory, 26-12. </p>
							</br>
							<p> The third and final pool math of the day was long-time rival Indiana. In the four years that the Big Ten has played 7s, Purdue and IU have surprisingly never met on the field. The Boilers were already through to the cup semifinal by virtue of Purdue and IU both going 2-0 in the pool to that point, but this game obviously had a lot riding on the line.</p>
							</br>
							<p> A challenging IU side came out fast, and though Purdue possessed the ball for the first few minutes, Indiana let at the half 17-0. They would go on to add two more tries in the second and win, 31-0.</p>
							</br>
							<p> Down but not out - Purdue had to quickly turn their attention to the semifinal vs. the winner of Pool A: Wisconsin. Off to a slow start, Purdue was down at half for the fourth game in a row, 17-7.</p>
							</br>
							<p> An extremely impressive effort in the second had Purdue battle back, scoring two more tries and holding Wisconsin to 0 points. However, a conversion kick from the sideline with time expired could not be had, and the Boilers and Badgers headed into overtime, 17-17.</p>
							</br>
							<p> Purdue threatened early but could not hold on to the ball. Wisconsin took advantage of the turnover and linked phases together to drive deep into Purdue territory. Despite an outstanding string of goal-line defense, Wisconsin was able to dive over the line and score the sudden-death try, winning 22-17.</p>
							</br>
							<p> Purdue then played familiar foe Michigan in the 3rd place game. The Boilers and Wolverines had split the first two games of the year, with the margins of victory being 1 and 5 points. The game was another close contest, and Purdue was once again down 12-10 at half. A try for each team in the second was not enough for the Boilers to close the gap, and Michigan won 17-15.</p>
							</br>
							<p> â€ªThe Boilermakers finished 4th on the day and 4th in the Big Ten for the 2015 7s season.</p>
